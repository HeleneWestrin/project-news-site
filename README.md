# The Featherington â€“ A news site about birds

The project involves creating a responsive news or magazine website. The site must include a header with the site's name, logo, and a navbar that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

The layout should feature a main news section and a grid of news cards, which adjusts the number of cards per row based on screen size: four on desktop, two on tablets, and one on mobile. The project requires using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, adhering to responsive design principles, and deploying the final site on Netlify.
