# The Featherington â€“ A news site about birds

The project involves creating a responsive news or magazine website. The site must include a header with the site's name, logo, and a navbar that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

The layout should feature a main news section and a grid of news cards, which adjusts the number of cards per row based on screen size: four on desktop, two on tablets, and one on mobile. The project requires using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, adhering to responsive design principles, and deploying the final site on Netlify.

## The problem

I started out by searching for some inspiration for the layout. I then sketched out a rough idea in Figma on how I wanted it to look. I chose my theme based on the fact that birds are pretty and finding good, free images of them is quite easy.

I used ChatGPT to create topics for me and also a preamble to each article.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
